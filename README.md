This extension adds support for
[Secuyou Smart Lock](https://www.secuyou.dk/collections/produkter/products/secuyou-smart-lock-med-venstre-greb) for
terrace doors.

## Supported Things

Following thing type is supported by this extension:

* [Secuyou Smart Lock](https://www.secuyou.dk/collections/produkter/products/secuyou-smart-lock-med-venstre-greb) model
  2.21

The lock must already have been setup in the Secuyou app.

> NOTE: Only tested with a single lock of model 2.21 and firmware version 6. Might work somewhat on older models.

> NOTE2: Flaky firmware; sometimes when manually locked by touching the device, the lock reports UNKNOWN/IN PROGRESS
> status (neither LOCKED nor UNLOCKED) for a while. In the app this can be seen as a grayed out lock symbol while still
> reporting that the phone is connected to the lock.

> NOTE3: Make sure you have set "Home Lock" to true - or the lock will assume your BLE dongle is a nearby phone and not
> trigger auto locking.
